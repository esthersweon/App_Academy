# SQL Assessment Practice

## Instructions

You have 30 minutes to write SQL queries for the following questions.

Fill in the required SQL in the `lib/movie_sql.rb` file. The spec file
(run with `rspec`) will check your work (go for the green!). You may
wish to use the command-line sqlite3 program to interactively
experiment with SQL, but this is not required. Please do not use the
internet.

Run the following command within this directory to create the database:

    ./import_db.sh

In `sqlite3` you can list all tables with `.tables` and view the
database schema with `.schema`.

After 30 minutes (or upon completion), 
pat yourself on the back for your efforts.

## Notes

0. Order matters; the spec will enforce this.
1. Make sure to terminate sqlite3 commands with semicolons, otherwise
   they don't execute.
2. Good luck!

Focus and conquer!
